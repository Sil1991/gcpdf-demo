Want to contribute? Great! First, read this page (including the small print at
the end).

Google Cloud Dataflow SDK is a distribution of Apache Beam. If you'd like to
change anything under the `org.apache.beam.*` namespace, please submit that
change directly to the [Apache Beam](https://github.com/apache/beam) project.

This repository contains code to build the Dataflow distribution of Beam, and
some Dataflow-specific code. Only changes to how the distribution is built, or
the Dataflow-specific code under the `com.google.cloud.dataflow.*` namespace,
can be merged here.

### Before you contribute
Before we can use your code, you must sign the
[Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual?csw=1)
(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the
copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also
need to be sure of various other things. For instance that you'll tell us if you
know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign
the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.

Before you start working on a larger contribution, we recommend to get in touch
with us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out
and possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

### Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.

### The small print
Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than
the one above, the Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement.
